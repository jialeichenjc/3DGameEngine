## Synopsis
This project is a 3D game engine written in C++ for windows.

## Motivation
It was a part of the coursework for my Master's in game development and
it has been in continuous development and improvement ever since. 

## Code Structure
Engine/ contains all the engine code
(A hot chunk of mess architecture-wise, after collision I'll re-organize it)

MonsterChase/ is a small game that demonstrates using the engine
(I'll update or modify that to be more interesting, or I'll just
delete..we'll see)

# API Reference
coming soon, need re-organization.

## Tests
Currently the unit tests are part of the engine under the Unit Tests folder.
I would probably integrate more rigid testing paradigms later.

## Contributers
Just me, nothing to check progress...yet

(I realized that this readme sounds pretty slack; most of my energy now is 
spent on getting everything to function. It shall improve :D)
